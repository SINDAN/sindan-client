# SINDAN Measurement Metrics
## Layer

| Layer Name ||
|---|---|
| hardware layer | Collect hardware and other relevant information to determine the status of client terminals for which network measurements are to be performed. |
| datalink layer | This corresponds to Layer 2 of the OSI reference model and is the measurement layer for verifying connectivity with neighboring devices. It checks whether a link can be established by monitoring the network interfaces' up/down status. In wireless networks, it measures up to the point where association is established, while also collecting connection parameters required for link-up. |
| interface layer | This layer verifies the IP address configuration at Layer 3 of the OSI reference model. For IPv4, it checks automatic address assignment via DHCP. For IPv6, it verifies address assignment via SLAAC using RA or via DHCPv6. |
| localnet layer | This layer checks IP reachability within the same segment (local network). While this layer also includes local network service discovery using mDNS (Bonjour, Avahi) and LLMNR (Windows), currently, only the reachability of the default gateway and name servers is verified. |
| globalnet layer | This layer verifies IP reachability to external servers outside the organization. In addition to reachability checks (such as round-trip time (RTT) using ping and path analysis using traceroute), path MTU is also measured. |
| dns layer | Name resolution, which translates domain names into IP addresses, is a critical function for application usage, and this layer is responsible for verifying it. In dual-stack environments, name resolution must be checked for both IPv4 and IPv6, as behavior can vary depending on the resolver API provided by the operating system. Therefore, DNS resolution is performed using both the name servers obtained via DHCP/DHCPv6/RA and any specified public DNS servers. |
| app layer | This layer corresponds to Layer 5 and above of the OSI reference model; currently, only the application layer is being evaluated. It verifies whether application-layer communication with external servers outside the organization is possible, and also measures throughput using the iNonius speed test site. |
